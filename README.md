# Multiscale spectral graph neural networks for hyperspectral imaging

This repo is currently based on the code https://github.com/qichaoliu/CNN_Enhanced_GCN
Environment: python 3.10.9, torch 2.1.0, scipy 1.11.3, spectral 0.23.1, scikit-image 0.19.3, qhull 2020.2 ...

Note: 
* Change hyper-parameters and paths in Main.py
* This version includes 2-scale gnn for spatial and 1d cnn for spectral features.
